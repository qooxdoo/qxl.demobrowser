  This demo showcases the qooxdoo REST wrapper with the aid of the <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/">GitHub OAuth2</a>
  implementation and the <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/gists/">GitHub Gists API</a>.
  The requirements to run it is that you have a GitHub account with gists associated with it.
</p>
<p>
  This demo is not expected to run in the context of the demo browser because it needs a backend component (a php file).
  For a working example, please open the hosted <a href="http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/github/">REST demo application</a>.
  You will be asked to login to GitHub (if not already logged in) and grant the "qx-gists" application access to your public gists.
</p>
<p>
  The GitHub demo application is included in the SDK (under /application/github).
  Please see the comments in the index.php file to customize it to your environment.
